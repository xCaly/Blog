                        My last hobby that saved me from the boredom of quarantine is BAKING! 
I learned baking from my mom, she taught me well enough that I make my own pastry whenever there is an 
occassion, or when I am bored! HAHAHAHA. My favorite thing to bake are strawberry cupcakes and cinnamon rolls - they’re
just the best! I am glad my family enjoys my baking too that sometimes they request for me to bake them something for
snacks ~ I look forward to learning more recepies and maybe create a unique one of my own in the future. </span>

                I love painting! Both traditional painting and digital painting. I find that making art on my free time relaxes me a lot.
How lines and colors come together just amazes me. I first started my art journey with acryclic painting, above you can 
see my two favorite pieces that I made. One is a girl sending her wishes to the ight sky in front of a full moon, the second
one is two people on a canoe enjoying their time as they drift on the sea during sunset. 

        I believe that making art can not only make you feel better, but it can also make others feel happy especially when 
you make a piece for them. On the third pic (the collage of circular icons), you can see art I made for my friends that I
met in game. I felt so happy when they told me how much they appreciate my work and how they think I’m good at art.</span>

        I volunteered on our local COVID-19 research and testing center!  The government looked for several volunteers 
up for this task and I signed myself up! We were intensively trained for more than 2 weeks about safety, hygiene and protocol.
I met a lot of brave and friendly researchers, microbiologists, nurses, doctors and other volunteers! I I helped a lot of people 
and it makes me feel good. There are even times that companies who go to our testing center will give us food and freebies!
We aren’t getting paid for doing this, and I dont mind that all because this is a great learning experience for me. 

        My favorite part of my volunteering adventure is during Eid where everyone prepared for an indoor festival on 
the building and different teams contribute their own presentation. There were giveaways from several companies and girls
were even given roses as a token of appreciation of what we do. We have different zones here to protect the people from
those who have covid and each zone has their designated color. I am from the yellow zone, where people come back to get
tested again hoping that they’d get a 2nd negative result so they can take out their watch tracker(a device used by the 
government to track people with COVID-19).  I enjoyed this experience very much and I’m thankful I helped a lot of people.</span>

        A girl lost in her own world, one who day dreams fantasies and magic.  I am Maria Cassandra Vitug, a 20 yr old girl stucked 
inside cause of the pandemic. I currently live the beautiful Khalifa City in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Enrolled as a freshie in BS 
Computer Science @DLSU-D. My favourite hobby to pass time is probably gaming - may it be PS4, computer or mobile games - i play
it all! My favorite games are God of War, League of Legends and Assassins Creed.


                   I know life has become dull, very mundane infact because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are all stucked in quarantine and
it sucks but luckily I found a way to entertain myself the past year! As you can see from above I have tried a lot of hair colors. I find it 
fun how I can express different sides of me based on the current hair color that I have. So far I have tried pink, blonde, platinum blonde,
auburn, red, violet, copper brown and dark blue. With the help of YouTube tutorial videos, bleach and hair dye I achieved those! (see
pics above.) Below I will present more hobbies/ things that I did during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
